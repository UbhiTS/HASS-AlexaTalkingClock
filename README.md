Amazon Alexa will keep on reminding you of the time from morning till night and also courteously greet with a good morning, good afternoon, and a good night & sweet dreams all without you having to lift a finger (or speak a word). Sweet!

## Thank you for your time! (get it ;)
This app was a result of my amazing wife's request (who is a mother of 2 beautiful princesses BTW) to help her manage her time wisely ;). So this is dedicated to my wife Reena, without whom this world would not be worth my time :) 

This also wouldn't be possible without the amazing work done by the developers and community at **[Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/)**, and of Keaton Taylor and Alan Tse on their **Alexa Media Player integration** for Home Assistant. *https://github.com/custom-components/alexa_media_player*

Ever since we've set this up in our home, it has become an indispensable part of our lives. It's amazing to see how a simple reminder of the current time in the day can make people more efficient :), I hope this app helps others as it has helped us. 

If you like my work and feel gracious, you can buy me a beer below ;)
